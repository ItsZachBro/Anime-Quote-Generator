The api is using a potentially temporary site since the old site is having issues, causing the api to fail. 
Small edit in the code to use the current api hosting site. If this goes down, change code or upload the other version.
API is being hosted on an HTTP site instead of an HTTPS site which causes mixed content errors on many hosting sites. it works when running it from a computer.
I'll update the code when the HTTPS site is working again
